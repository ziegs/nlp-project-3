# Usage: prettyprint [files]
#
# Quick and dirty prettyprinter for LISP-like expressions.
# Prettyprints all the input, except lines that start with # (i.e., comments).
# No assumption about input whitespace except that it separates sister atoms.

# Author: Jason Eisner <jason@cs.jhu.edu>, 
#         2001-09-08: Created for 600.465 HW1.
#         2001-10-20: Modified for 600.465 HW3 to allow first list element
#                     to be a list itself.  Not sure why - maybe to accept
#                     the output of the simplify script?
#         2002-06-28: Modified original so it could be used as an interactive
#                     filter rather than reading a whole file before printing
#                     anything.
#         2002-10-24: Merged the two previous modifications.
#         2003-10-21: Skip comment lines.
#
# TO DO: Perhaps when the indent level is 0, we should preserve whitespace
#        (or perhaps even all lines that don't start with \s\*\(, even if
#        they contain parens).
